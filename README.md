Game of Thrones Character App
About the Project
This project is a React application that allows users to view and search for characters from the Game of Thrones series. It fetches character data from an external API and presents it in a user-friendly interface. Users can search for characters by name, and the application will dynamically filter the results.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests.
CSS: For styling the components.
The application is structured with components for character display (CharacterGrid.jsx and CharacterItem.jsx), search functionality (Search.jsx), and a header (Header.jsx). The main application logic is contained within App.jsx.
